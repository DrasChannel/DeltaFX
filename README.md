# DeltaFX website source code

DeltaFX is a website that provides digital 3d assets (PBR Materials, Models, etc.) under the cc0 (public domain) license.
This repo contains source code for the website.

## How to run

The website is built using plain HTML/CSS/JS/PHP.
You can run it on a live server, but if you want downloading to work, then you need to host a server for php.
I recommend using this php server vscode extension: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=brapifra.phpserver
